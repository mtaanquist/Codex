# TODO

Working checklist against `scratch/system-design/roadmap.md`. One roadmap step
per line; details live in the roadmap. Cross off as things merge to develop.

## Phase 1 - Foundations

- [x] 1. Scaffold SvelteKit + TypeScript on adapter-node, with test harness
- [x] 2. Drizzle + node-postgres, users table, first migration
- [x] 3. Dockerfile, compose.yaml (app, worker stub, postgres, Caddy), compose.dev.yaml
- [x] 4. Run the stack in Docker end to end
- [x] 5. Sign-in: sessions, auth_tokens, password check, server hook guard
- [x] 6. Seed admin via SQL; verify sign-in and the approval gate

> v0.1 shipped at the end of Phase 1.

## Phase 2 - Core content

- [x] 7. universes, stories tables; CRUD pages
- [x] 8. Shell layout port from prototype (top bar, three columns, CSS tokens)
- [x] 9. Focus mode
- [x] 10. chapters, scenes; scene tree in left sidebar
- [x] 11. CodeMirror 6 editor, debounced autosave, Compartment wrapping
- [x] 12. Drag-to-reorder scenes
- [x] 12b. Continuous story view, read-only (pulled forward from Phase 6)

> v0.5 shipped at the end of Phase 2 (plus v0.2 along the way).

## Phase 3 - Worldbuilding

- [x] 13. Characters: schema, Plan view CRUD, story notes overlay, aliases
- [x] 14. Entity mentions index, worker rebuild, editor underlines, hover tooltips
- [x] 15. Find usages / appears-in panels
- [x] 16a. Places (v1.1): schema, Plan view, story notes, mention pipeline
- [x] 16b. Lore entries and entity categories (v1.2), incl. entity-colour groupings
- [x] 17. Universe editor (v1.3): universe-scoped Plan view, no "In this book" without a story, dashboard lists stories per universe and routes the universe name to the editor (Notes view still does not exist at any scope; it stays a disabled toggle)
- [x] 18. Entity relationships (v1.4): relation_types + entity_relationships schema (story_id and custom types modelled, no UI yet), 15 built-ins seeded by migration, editor section with typed picker + target select + notes, right-panel card, inverse labels on the target's page
- [x] 19. Outline tree (v1.5): outline_nodes schema, Outline group atop the story Plan sidebar (drag reorders siblings, buttons indent/outdent), node editor with notes and scene/chapter link, delete promotes children (placement and nesting interaction confirmed with the author; no designed screen existed)
- [x] 20. Declared story membership: membership tables, story Plan lists members-or-mentioned, create-in-story declares, "From the universe..." select adds existing entities, editor shows the standing with add/remove (ships with v1.6)
- [x] 21. Entity autocomplete (v1.6): completion source over names and aliases, popup and ghost-text modes in the reserved compartment, user preference (popup default) stored in users.preferences; the three-option select sits on the dashboard until Display settings arrives at step 32

> Phase 3 complete: v1.0 shipped after step 15 (gated on the full code
> review; findings fixed, leftovers in the backlog below), then v1.1
> through v1.6 in turn. Next is Phase 4 (history, polish, import/export),
> steps 22-27, releasing as v2.0. The author holds 3 free /code-review
> ultra runs, intended for phase boundaries.

## Feedback backlog

From first real use (2026-06-03):

- [ ] Scene marks in the continuous view should be hideable (display preference; rides with roadmap step 23b or the preferences UI)
- [ ] Editable continuous view: promoted to roadmap step 23b, ships as a v1.x release
- [ ] Spell-check from a user language preference (Phase 6 candidate; browser-native first)
- [ ] Markdown affordances: renderer lands with Phase 4 exports and reading pages (continuous view picks it up); in-editor styling and the prototype's toolbar as polish after; visibility of marks likely a display preference
- [ ] Preference layering: user-level preferences with per-story overrides merged at render time (same pattern as llm_config); story-level column is an additive migration
- [x] Entity colours with meaning: shipped with v1.2 (characters/places join categories; badge takes the category colour)

From the pre-v1.0 code review (2026-06-03); the four fixable findings were fixed:

- [ ] Mention attribution is first-match when two entities share an identical name or alias; needs a dedupe/disambiguation design (mention-detect.ts)
- [ ] Hover tooltip re-runs full-document detection per hover; read from the existing decoration set instead (editor-mentions.ts)
- [ ] applySceneOrder issues one UPDATE per scene; batch into a single statement when stories grow (scene-order.ts)
- [x] CI never ran the Docker image, so a broken worker import closure shipped silently (caught by hand at v1.6: src/lib was missing from the image since step 14). Fixed in v1.6.1 with a docker-smoke CI job that builds the image and boots compose with a worker check

Later phases tracked in the roadmap until they get close.
